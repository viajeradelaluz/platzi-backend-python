<br>

Increase your technical skills by efficiently using data in your Python programs. Apply different data structures: arrays, linked lists, stacks and queues.

- Understand the essential operations of collections
- Know the use cases of data structures
- Build your own data structures
- Understand the operation of arrays, lists, stacks and queues

## Data Structures Introduction

- Types of collections
- Essential operations with collections
- Built-in collections in Python

## Linear Data Structures

- Arrays - See a 3D-array example in [cube.py](cube.py)

```python
3D array = [
	[
		[14, 14, 16, 7]
		[5, 6, 10, 12]
		[10, 16, 14, 8]
	]
	[
		[16, 15, 20, 10]
		[17, 19, 8, 6]
		[14, 11, 1, 12]
	]
]
