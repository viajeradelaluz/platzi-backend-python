It happens when you have to add new functionality to the system. Every bit of functionality has to go somewhere, right? It seems sensible to put the new stuff into an existing class. But now the class has more than one thing to do.\n","\n","Let‚Äôs look at our card game. One of the first classes we implemented is `PlayingCard`. It knows its rank and suit, whether it‚Äôs face-up, and whether it‚Äôs better than any other card.\n","\n","But, there‚Äôs a common situation in which we‚Äôd need to keep changing this class. Can you see what it is? ü§î\n","\n","Yes‚Äîevery time we want to use these cards for a different game with different rules (such as with the lower cards being worth more), we need to modify or replace the PlayingCard class! _PlayingCard shouldn‚Äôt be responsible for implementing game logic_, as then whenever the game logic changes, it must change in tandem.\n","\n","In real life, you don't need different decks for every card game you play.
