    "## What Is Liskov Substitution?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inheritance** starts as a cool idea. You have one existing concept and then want to add another. And this new concept is just a more specific implementation of the original. Easy, **derive a new class!**\n",
    "\n",
    "But over time, it‚Äôs **easy to abuse inheritance**. And when there are too many layers of inheritance, it‚Äôs natural to lose track of what specific classes are supposed to be doing. Eventually, some class gets added that can‚Äôt do something its parent classes need to do, and the system breaks.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a violation of Liskov substitution, which says:\n",
    "\n",
    "<blockquote style=\"padding: 1em; border-radius: 5px; font-style: italic;\">\n",
    "<strong>Child</strong> class objects should be able to replace <strong>parent</strong> class objects without breaking the integrity of the application.\n",
    "</blockquote>\n",
    "\n",
    "Or, to put this another way:\n",
    "\n",
    "Any code calling methods on objects of a specific type should continue to work when those objects get replaced with instances of a subtype.\n",
    "\n",
    "<blockquote style=\"padding: 1em; border-radius: 5px; font-style: italic;\">\n",
    "What‚Äôs a subtype?\n",
    "</blockquote>\n",
    "\n",
    "A **subtype** can be either a class extending another class or a class implementing an interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "This principle is named after **Barbara Liskov**, one of the first women in the United States to earn a doctorate in computer science. She is also the creator of the Argus and CLU programming languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "She introduced the Liskov substitution principle in her conference keynote talk, ‚ÄúData Abstraction‚Äù in 1987.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./barbara_liskov.jpg\" alt=\"Barbara Liskov\" style=\"width:150px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Being a computer scientist, she defined this formally as:\n",
    "\n",
    "<blockquote style=\"padding: 1em; border-radius: 5px; font-style: italic;\">\n",
    "Let Œ¶(x) be a property provable about objects x of type T. Then Œ¶(y) should be true for objects y of type S where S is a subtype of T.\n",
    "</blockquote>\n",
    "\n",
    "It's very theoretical, so if you‚Äôre anything like me, you‚Äôll probably find it easier to think about this principle using the previous definitions!"

    "## Why Use the Liskov Substitution Principle?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let‚Äôs say you have a class called cat. It has a method in it called `eat()`. You can pass a standard cat food brand - i.e., Kitten Munch - into the eat method, and the cat is fine. üêà If you add a new class, Tiger, which is a kind of cat, it will reimplement the eat method. üêÖ\n",
    "\n",
    "However, tigers won't eat dry food that comes from a bag. They eat raw meat. That‚Äôs not a behavior you‚Äôve seen before. Surprise! üò¨\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem happens when you think passing Kitten Munch into the eat method works for every cat. A tiger is a cat, so it should work. But it doesn't. So, you can‚Äôt just put a tiger in your system in places where you've had a cat.\n",
    "\n",
    "It violates the **Liskov substitution principle**: you can't replace a base class (Cat), with a derived class (Tiger), without affecting the rest of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Liskov substitution principle helps by **limiting your use of inheritance**. While it is easy to come up with low-level, concrete implementation classes (hey, they do what you want them to do), it is better to step back and think of a high-level abstraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's try to fix the cat and tiger problem. You have two concrete (that is, specific implementation) classes. You need to introduce a couple of higher-level interfaces/abstractions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Carnivore, which only eats meat.\n",
    "- Omnivore, which eats meat and other things (like Kitten Munch).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now when you add any animal, you can have it implement one of those two interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "It made sense at the start to have a tiger be a kind of cat. But then you saw the problem when you got to implementation. **It‚Äôs often hard to recognize** when Liskov is going to be violated **ahead of time**. But when you discover a violation, you need to rethink your use of inheritance. So, when looking to use inheritance, ask yourself:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Does the derived class have a meaningful implementation for all overridden methods? If so, that's a good thing. ‚úÖ\n",
    "- Would implementing an overridden method be out of the ordinary, possibly resulting in throwing an exception? If so, that's bad. ‚ùå\n",
    "- Would implementing an overridden method ignore the call, and do nothing? Usually, that's a bad thing, but might be justifiable. You should keep an eye out if the derived class does this for:\n",
    "  - A single method. ‚úÖ\n",
    "  - Many of them. ‚ùå\n"

    "Whenever we want a view component for broadcasting, we‚Äôll need another component that interacts with the players. So we could create a class called `PlayersAndBroadcastView` that handles everything.\n",
