We will examine each one in-depth as the course progresses. We'll also put them into practice by improving our card game application. Let's get an overview of these key ideas:\n","\n","- **\"S\" is for single responsibility.**\n","  Each class or function should do one thing and do it well. It should only have one reason to change.\n","\n","- **\"O\" is for open/closed principle.**\n","  A class should be open to extension but closed to modification.\n","\n","> What on Earth does that mean?\n","\n","Well, ideally, it should be easy to add a new concept to the system by **extending** the original functionality without duplicating loads of code. And ideally, you shouldn’t have to make **modifications** to existing code in the process.\n","\n","- **\"L\" for Liskov substitution.**\n","\n","Subclasses should be able to do everything that their parent classes can. If you replace a parent class with one of its subclasses, it shouldn’t break your system!\n","\n","**\"I\" for interface segregation.**\n","Essentially, the single responsibility principle, applied to interfaces.\n","\n","**\"D\" is for dependency inversion.**\n","Parent classes shouldn't have to change when one of their subclasses is modified.\n","\n","As you will see, these design patterns are effective because they demonstrate these principles! We will be using them to improve the card game we wrote when we explored MVC.\n","\n","### Let’s Recap!\n","\n","- Cleaner designs are easier to understand, maintain, modify, and test.\n","- Following the SOLID principles leads to cleaner design.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"avLyRdFad-ik"},"source":["## Acoplamiento y cohesión\n","\n","**Acoplamiento:** Forma y nivel de interdepencia entre módulos de software.\n","\n","- _Software desacoplado o de bajo acoplamiento:_ independencia entre módulos (ideal para programar).\n","- _Software acoplado:_ dependencia moderada entre módulos.\n","\n","**Cohesión:** grado de cercanía que une el código (métodos y clases de un módulo) responsable de un solo actor.\n","\n","- _Cohesión alta:_ elementos estrechamente relacionados (ideal para programar).\n","- _Cohesión baja:_ elementos vagamente relacionados."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Bibliografía\n","\n","### Libros\n","\n","- Martin, Robert C.
