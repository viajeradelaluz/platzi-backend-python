    "\n",
    "First of all, you can create a dedicated **folder structure** specifically for your testing. This method will group all the tests for an application together in the same place.\n",

    "Best practices for organizing tests:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a test folder structure to mirror the source file directory.\n",
    "- Name the test files with the same name as the source file with a prefix of `test_`.\n",
