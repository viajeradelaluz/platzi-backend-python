    "- Manual testing, which is carried out by a human, usually the person responsible for quality assurance on a project, or the end client. The aim of this is to check that the different features were developed in line with the functional specifications.\n",

    "### Unit Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "Unit testing is at the base of the test pyramid. As the name suggests, the aim of unit testing is to test a **single unit of code**. A unit might be a method or a function, for example. To be considered a unit test, it mues meet one specific rule:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **A unit test cannot be dependent on any functionality outside of the unit being tested.**\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a test that accesses a database, an API or another method wouldn't be considered a unit test.\n",

    "\n",
    "If you think about it, one project is likely to involve the developoment of many features. Sometimes, when working as a team, there are a number of developers involved. Integration testing will check that all features being developed will **work together**.\n",
    "\n",
    "As with unit testing, integration testing is executed automatically by a computer. This makes test execution quicker and more reliable. The testing is **based on technical specifications**, which means that the program **architecture** will be tested.\n",
    "\n",
    "> For the Crocoplus project, we might decide to implement an automated meal system. Our method, which we'll call `serve_meal()`, will be responsible for ensuring that all crocodiles are red by calling the `feed_crocodile()` method. We want to check that if `serve_meal()` is executed, the crodoiles'last meal date is updated. So, we're going to test the expected result by calling the `feed_crocodile()` method. Becouse out test depends on a function other than the one we're testing, this is an integration test.\n"
