Have you ever spent hours trying to find the root cause of a bug? Testing, retesting, and testing once again before finally working out what the problem was? We’ve all been there! What if I told you that you could have **automated** these tests, letting the computer play the role of detective instead of you?

Python makes it **really easy** for you to test a project. In this course, you’ll discover the power of unit **testing**, as well as other **types of testing** such as integrated and functional testing. You’ll also see how you can become a more efficient programmer by using **test-driven development**. Prepare to be impressed!
