# Introduction to Computational Thinking with Python

**[platzi](https://platzi.com/cursos/python-cs/) | David Aroesti**

<br>

This is the introductory course to learn how to think like a software engineer and computer scientist for the Platzi platform.

## Learning Objectives

- Learn to solve problems computationally.
- Develop the foundation for a career in computer science.
- Understand the common points between all programming languages. 

## Syllabus

### Introduction to computing

- Computing history: what does it mean to compute.
- Some computing machines: Turing machine, ENIAC, EDVAC, Von Neumann Architecture.
- Programming paradigms: imperative paradigm, declarative paradigm, event-driven programming, concurrent programming.

### Introduction to Python

- Working with variables and primary data types: strings, floats, int and booleans.
- Manage control structures: if-else statements, loops.

### Numerical programs 

- `exhaustive_enumeration.py` - Module to try all the numerical possibilities to find the square root of a number.
- `approximation.py` - Try all the numerical possibilities, by aproximation (or epsilon) to find the square root of a number.
- `binary_search_array` - Finds a number by binary search. The search place is given by an array.
- `square_root_rocks.py`- Program that incorporates the three previous methods to get the square root of a number.
- `square_root_binary_search.py` - Finds the square root of a number by binary search. The search place is implemented through the algorithm.

**Usage:** Install Python (version 3 or later) and run the scripts with the instruction `python3 file_name.py`

```sh
viajeradelaluz@platzi:~/computational_thinking$ python3 square_root_rocks.py

·······Welcome to Square Root Rocks!········

Enter a number to get the square root: 16
Select the method:
    [1] - Exhaustive enumeration
    [2] - Aproximation
    [3] - Binary search
